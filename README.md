- Click on the `GET SOME VETABLES` button to go to the Index Page (The Shop)

On the Index Page, there is a display of all vegetables in stock

- Clicking on any vegetable takes you to its Show Page

On the Show Page, you have access to buy, edit, delete and restock

Clicking on the `ADD NEW VEGETABLE` button takes you to the New Page where there is opportunity to add more vegetables

- Enter the name, url of image, inventory and price to create a new vegetable

You can restock on the Edit Page
